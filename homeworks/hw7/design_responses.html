						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned how the Gestalt principles reflect on how the human brain perceives different visual elements. I already knew that even if an image didn't have a clearly defined outline, people could still recognize it, but I didn't know that our brain bounces through different alternatives when viewing ambiguous objects. I thought that this was interesting to learn about because it showcases how flexible the human mind is and how we process information. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the visual examples that were provided. I enjoyed seeing the images reflect what was written in the text because it made it easier to understanding what was written and see different elements that make a good design. The colors that were utilized in the graphics were also enjoyable to look at and really highlighted the main ideas they were trying to convey.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "User Interface Design isn’t all about pretty pixels and sparkly graphics. It’s mainly about communication, performance and convenience." </p>
						</li>

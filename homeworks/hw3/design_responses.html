							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned how important font pairing is and how it can affect how readable designs can be. Before reading this article, I was already aware about the importance of choosing fonts that are readable, but I didn't know that how fonts were paired together could also affect the design. While two fonts may look great on its own, they may clash when you put it together in the same design. </p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that the size of devices can affect the duration of animations. I never thought about how the size of the screen can change how fast or slow something is animated, but seeing the animation example, I notice that it seems slower on larger screens and faster on smaller screens. I thought that this was an interesting thing to learn and important to consider in future designs that I make. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was seeing the example animations/GIF that explain what the author is talking about. I think that it helps to see it visually because it helps readers better understand what makes something a bad design verses why something else is a good design. The animations are also interesting to look at and allows me to compare different designs and make better design choices in the future. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Imitating the behavior of objects from the real world we can create a sequence that allows users to understand what to expect from the interface." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

                            <p> I learned that there are diverse kinds of UI designs that people like. There are many different color and type combinations that people utilize to give their designs personality. The design choices that they make also reflect on the purpose they want their app to have. </p>

                            <p> My favorite part of this article was being able to see all the different designs that people made. It was interesting to see how the app moves and functions and what the different screens/webpages looked like.

                            <p> I like the website design for Prism. I thought that the color scheme, font, and photos that they used worked really well together to convey a sophisticated/unique feeling. The transitions and the animation that the website had when someone would scroll through it also looked really cool. The overall layout added a lot of personality to the website which made it interesting and appealing to look at.</p>
